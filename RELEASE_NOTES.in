GetData-0.9.0 fixes bugs found in the 0.8-series.  It also adds PHP
bindings, a FLAC encoding, write support for bzip2 and xz-compressed
datafiles.  GetData-0.9.0 has been tested on various platforms including
Linux, MaxOS X, OpenBSD, Cygwin, and native Microsoft Windows.

Full release notes are given below; the following changes to the build
system should be noted especially:

* the legacy (pre-0.3) API is no longer built by default.  Pass
  --enable-legacy-api to the configure script to enable it.
* building support for the FLAC encoding reqires Xiph.Org's libFLAC.
* the Python bindings now require NumPy; previously, it was optional
* building the PHP bindings requires the PHP command-line interpreter to
  be installed at configure time

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four packages are available:
* getdata-0.9.0.tar.bz2/.gz: the full source code to the library, with
    bindings.  This package uses the GNU autotools build system, and is
    designed for POSIX systems (UNIX, Linux, BSD, MacOS X, Cygwin, MSys,
    &c.)
* getdata_win-0.9.0.zip: a reduced source code package, with the CMake
    build system designed to be built on Microsoft Windows, either using
    the free MinGW compiler, or else Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler.
    (The full source package above can also be built using MinGW, if the
    MSys shell is used to run the build system.)  Currently, the only
    bindings provided by this package are the C++ bindings, and the
    package lacks support for compressed dirfiles, the Legacy API, and a
    few other features.  This build is used in native Microsoft Windows
    builds of kst2.
* idl_getdata-0.9.0.tar.bz2/.gz: the Interactive Data Language (IDL)
    bindings, packaged separately with an autotools build system, designed
    to be built against an already installed version of GetData.  Due to
    licensing restrictions, pre-built packages rarely come with these
    bindings, and this package allows end-users to add support for IDL
    without having to recompile the whole GetData package.
* matlab_getdata-0.9.0.tar.bz2/.gz: the MATLAB bindings, packaged
    separately with an autotools build system, designed to be built against
    an already installed version of GetData.  Due to licensing
    restrictions, pre-built packages rarely come with these bindings, and
    this package allows end- users to add support for MATLAB without having
    to recompile the whole GetData package.
