.TH gd_nframes 3 "29 November 2016" "Version 0.10.0" "GETDATA"
.SH NAME
gd_nframes \(em report the size of a dirfile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <getdata.h>
.HP
.nh
.ad l
.BI "off_t gd_nframes(DIRFILE *" dirfile );
.hy
.ad n
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR gd_nframes ()
function queries a dirfile(5) database specified by
.I dirfile
and returns the number of frames in the database.  Since different fields may
have differing number of frames, the Dirfile Standards (see
.BR dirfile (5))
dictate that the number of frames in the database is defined to be equal to the
number of frames in the reference field defined by the
.B /REFERENCE
directive (see
.BR dirfile-format (5))
or, if no such reference field is defined, by the first raw field specified in
the format specification.

If no vector fields are defined in the database,
.BR gd_nframes ()
returns zero and succeeds.

The 
.I dirfile
argument must point to a valid DIRFILE object previously created by a call to
.BR gd_open (3).

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.BR gd_nframes ()
returns the number of frames in the dirfile, which is never negative.  On error,
it returns a negative-valued error code.  Possible error codes are:
.TP 8
.B GD_E_ALLOC
The library was unable to allocate memory.
.TP
.B GD_E_BAD_DIRFILE
The supplied dirfile was invalid.
.TP
.B GD_E_IO
An I/O error occurred while determining the number of samples in the data file
associated with the reference field.
.TP
.B GD_E_UNKNOWN_ENCODING
The number of samples available for the reference field could not be determined
because the encoding used to store the reference field's data file was not
understood.
.TP
.B GD_E_UNSUPPORTED
GetData does not support determining the number of samples for the encoding of
of the data file associated with the reference field.
.PP
The error code is also stored in the
.B DIRFILE
object and may be retrieved after this function returns by calling
.BR gd_error (3).
A descriptive error string for the error may be obtained by calling
.BR gd_error_string (3).
