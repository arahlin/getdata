.SH NAME
gd_spf \(em returns the samples per frame for a field in a
dirfile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <getdata.h>
.HP
.nh
.ad l
.BI "unsigned int gd_spf(DIRFILE *" dirfile ", const char *" field_code );
.hy
.ad n
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR gd_spf ()
function queries a dirfile(5) database specified by
.I dirfile
and determines the number of samples per frame for the field
.IR field_code .
This information is also available from
.BR gd_entry (3).

The 
.I dirfile
argument must point to a valid DIRFILE object previously created by a call to
.BR gd_open (3).

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.BR gd_spf ()
returns a positive integer indicating the number of samples per frame for the
field specified.  On error, it returns zero and stores a negative-valued error
code in the
.B DIRFILE
object which may be retrieved by a subsequent call to
.BR gd_error (3).
Possible error codes are:
.TP 8
.B GD_E_BAD_CODE
The field specified by
.I field_code
was not found in the database.
.TP
.B GD_E_BAD_DIRFILE
The supplied dirfile was invalid.
.TP
.B GD_E_DIMENSION
A scalar field was found where a vector field was expected.
.TP
.B GD_E_INTERNAL_ERROR
An internal error occurred in the library while trying to perform the task.
This indicates a bug in the library.  Please report the incident to the
maintainer.
.TP
.B GD_E_RECURSE_LEVEL
Too many levels of recursion were encountered while trying to resolve
.IR field_code .
This usually indicates a circular dependency in field specification in the
dirfile.
.PP
A descriptive error string for the error may be obtained by calling
.BR gd_error_string (3).
